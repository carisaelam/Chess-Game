# # GameFlow Class Goals

# [ ] Manage Turn Sequence
#   [ ] Alternate turns between players.
#   [ ] Keep track of which player's turn it is.

# [ ] Handle Move Execution
#   [x] Validate the move according to the rules of chess.
#   [x] Update the board with the new piece positions.
#   [ ] Handle special moves (e.g., castling, en passant).

# [ ] Validate Moves
#   [x] Check if a move is legal based on piece type and current board state.
#   [ ] Ensure that moves do not put the player's king in check.

# [ ] Check Game Status
#   [ ] Determine if the game has ended (checkmate, stalemate).
#   [ ] Handle game-ending conditions and notify players.

# [x] Handle Player Input
#   [x] Interpret player commands and translate them into moves.
#   [x] Provide feedback to players on invalid moves or game status.

# [ ] Maintain Game State
#   [ ] Keep track of the current game state (e.g., active pieces, board configuration).
#   [ ] Manage game history (optional, for undo/redo functionality).

# [ ] Interface with Other Classes
#   [x] Coordinate with the `Board` class to update and query the board state.
#   [x] Utilize `Piece` classes to validate and execute piece-specific moves.

# [ ] Provide Game Status Information
#   [ ] Display current game status (e.g., which playerâ€™s turn it is, if a player is in check).
